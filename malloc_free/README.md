`malloc` is a function in C used for dynamic memory allocation. It's like asking the computer for some temporary space to store your stuff.

## Usage
- To ask for memory, you call `malloc` and tell it how much memory you need.
- If everything goes well, `malloc` gives you a special pointer, which is like a ticket to find that space.
- You can use this pointer to store and access your data.
- When you're done using the memory, you give it back to the computer using `free`.
