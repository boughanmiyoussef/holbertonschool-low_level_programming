Command Line Arguments in C
This repository explores the concept of command line arguments in the C programming language. When executing a C program from the command line, it's possible to pass additional arguments to the program. These arguments can be accessed within the program using the argc and argv parameters in the main() function.

What's Included
argc: Stands for "argument count." It represents the number of command line arguments passed to the program, including the name of the program itself.

argv: Stands for "argument vector." It's an array of strings (char *argv[]) where each element represents a command line argument. argv[0] holds the name of the program, and subsequent elements (argv[1] to argv[argc-1]) hold the actual arguments passed to the program. argv[argc] is always NULL.

Usage
To use command line arguments in a C program, simply declare the main() function with two parameters: int argc and char *argv[]. The argc parameter indicates the number of arguments, while argv holds the arguments themselves.
